# Linear-and-Binary-search-Lab-Data-structures-lab-6
This Lab tests and compares binary and Linear search. 

ÔÅ¨ Program creates arrays of selected size with either string or integer elements. You
pick an element to search for and it runs both a linear and binary search on the
created arrays. For each search it shows a how long it took to find the element and
with that you can make a comparison to see which algorithm is more efficient.
